## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Building Software to me is no less than Sorcery! You can bring ideas to life - anything!

I have a few ideas that I want to work on. Here to contribute to projects and learn from the Open Source Community.
I talk to computers in Python, TypeScript and C++.

## Toolbox : 
* React
* React Native
* Python
* TailwindCSS
* Frappe Framework
* OpenCV.
